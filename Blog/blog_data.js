<h1>Hurricane Dorian</h1>
<p>
Hurricane Dorian was the strongest hurricane to affect the Bahamas on
record, causing catastrophic damage in the Abaco Islands and Grand
Bahama in early September 2019. The cyclone's intensity as well as its
slow forward motion near the Bahamas broke numerous records. The fifth
tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first
major hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Dorian
originated from a westward-traveling tropical wave that departed from
the western coast of Africa on August 19. The system organized into a
tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on August 24.

<h1>Dermotherium</h1>
<p>
Dermotherium is a genus of fossil mammals closely related to the
living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast
Asia. Two species are recognized: D. major from the Late Eocene of
Thailand, based on a single fragment of the lower jaw, and D. chimaera
from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the
lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single
isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been
tentatively assigned to D. chimaera. All sites where fossils of
Dermotherium have been found were probably forested environments and
the fossil species were probably forest dwellers like living colugos,
but whether they had the gliding adaptations of the living species is
unknown.

<h1>Planet of the Apes</h1>
<p>
Planet of the Apes is an American science fiction media franchise
consisting of films, books, television series, comics, and other media
about a world in which humans and intelligent apes clash for
control. The franchise is based on French author Pierre Boulle's 1963
novel La Planète des singes, translated into English as Planet of the
Apes or Monkey Planet. Its 1968 film adaptation, Planet of the Apes,
was a critical and commercial hit, initiating a series of sequels,
tie-ins, and derivative works. Arthur P. Jacobs produced the first
five Apes films through APJAC Productions for distributor 20th Century
Fox; since his death in 1973, Fox has controlled the franchise.

<h1>The Battle of Wesenberg (1268)</h1>
<p>
The Battle of Wesenberg, Rakvere or Rakovor was a battle fought on
February 18, 1268, between the combined forces of Danish Duchy of
Estonia, Bishopric of Dorpat, Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights,
and local Estonian militia on one side and the forces of Novgorod and
Pskov, led by Dmitry of Pereslavl, on the other. Medieval accounts of
the battle vary with both sides claiming victory, however the Livonian
victory being more plausible as Novgorodian-Pskovian forces retreated
out of Danish Estonia, with Livonian Knights launching a retaliatory
attack on Izborsk and Pskov soon afterward, in June 1269.

<h1>The Barber of Seville</h1>

osˈsiːa liˈnuːtile prekautˈtsjoːne]) is an opera buffa in two acts by
Gioachino Rossini with an Italian libretto by Cesare Sterbini. The

de Séville (1775). The première of Rossini's opera (under the title
Almaviva, o sia L'inutile precauzione) took place on 20 February 1816
at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, with designs by Angelo Toselli.
